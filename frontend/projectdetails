✅ Your Project Idea (Clear Description)

Your SkillSet platform connects people within the same community.
Anyone with a skill — gardening, plumbing, baking, tutoring, cleaning, electrical work, graphic design, etc. — can:

Create a profile

Display their skills

Set availability and pricing

Get hired by people in the same community

It’s like a local mini-marketplace for services, focused on helping neighbors help each other.
